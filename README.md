# supa-maryo (No further planned development at this time..)
- Live at: [numanaral.github.io/supa-maryo](https://numanaral.github.io/supa-maryo/).
- Built purely with web (React, ts & scss) without WebGL, canvas or any game library/framework.
  - You can inspect objects in the game and mess around with them directly in the Debugger Tools!

## What's the current progress:
- You can check the Project & issues for what was completed, but basically you can only really just move around at this point. I only had about 3-4 days to work on it, so the main progress was going to come this weekend (MapEditor, collision, mobs and game state).

## Why create this?	
- I actually started working on it for a React Summit conference which I was asked to become a speaker for.
  - Becoming a speaker was a life goal / dream for me, and I wanted to talk about something interesting and not covered by every single react dev already.
  - The goal with this project was not "building a game", but rather show "how to leverage react and its super powers" to create a fast-paced environment which needs handling various states, reacting to events, ways to optimize things, forward-thinking, pain points and their resolutions and so much more. I have been doing react for a long time and I can say that building a games with react allowed me to have deeper understanding of its inner workings. (thus why I thought this would be a great topic) 
  - The speakers were selected based on the usefulness of their topics (which I didn't really put much thought into), and I guess my topic was considered useless. I was just too naive to think that I was hand-picked to give a speech.
  - After working on this for on this for two weekends and not hearing anything, I decided to ask what's happening. Turns out, I wasn't selected. Would have been nice if I was told right away at least, but oh well.
  - I was once reminded again not to have high hopes on anything.

## So, what are the next steps?	
- Well I am actually quite busy working on some contract projects on the side (on top of my FT work), so I probably won't have any time to work on this as this is no longer a priority for me.
- I would love to come back to it at some point as I quite enjoyed building it, also would be nice to at least finish the core game, but who knows when that will happen.
- I actually had another game in my mind to work from a long time ago, so I may even just completely ditch this and never come back to it.
- Only time will tell..

## Sources for the assets / sprites:
- Note that I modified the sprite-sheets to make life easy for me and to further optimize lodaing assets.
  - You can check originals vs the edited versions in the assets folder.
